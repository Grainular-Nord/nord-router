/**
 * Represents a route configuration object in the NÃ¸rd-Router library.
 * Each route is defined with a specific path and can have associated route guards for activation and deactivation.
 * A route can define a component, child routes, or a redirect path, but only one of these options can be used per route.
 *
 * @type {Object} Route
 *
 * @property {`/${string}`} path - The path for the route. It should start with a forward slash and follow with a string.
 *
 * @property {RouteGuard[]} [onActivate] - Optional. An array of route guards that are called before the route is activated.
 *                                        These guards can determine if the route should be activated or not.
 *
 * @property {RouteGuard[]} [onDeactivate] - Optional. An array of route guards that are called before the route is deactivated.
 *                                           These guards can determine if the route should be deactivated or not.
 *
 * @property {Component<{}> | (() => Promise<Component<{}>>)} [component] - Optional. The component to render when the route is matched.
 *                                                                         Can be either a component or a function that returns a component asynchronously.
 *                                                                         This property is mutually exclusive with `children` and `redirect`.
 *
 * @property {Route[]} [children] - Optional. An array of child routes. This is used for nested routing.
 *                                  This property is mutually exclusive with `component` and `redirect`.
 *
 * @property {string} [redirect] - Optional. A path to redirect to when this route is matched.
 *                                 This property is mutually exclusive with `component` and `children`.
