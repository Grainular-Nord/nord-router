/**
 * The `Router` type represents the main routing interface in the NÃ¸rd-Router library.
 * It provides the core functionalities needed for navigating between routes,
 * rendering route components, and accessing route information.
 *
 * @type {Object} Router
 *
 * @property {Navigator} navigate - A function that initiates navigation to a specified route.
 *                                 The route is defined by an array of segments, which can be strings or any other types.
 *                                 This function returns a Promise that resolves when the navigation is complete.
 *                                 Example usage: `router.navigate(['/home'], { search: { ref: 'bookmark' } })`
 *
 * @property {Directive<Text>} outlet - A Directive that represents the location in the DOM where the routed component should be rendered.
 *                                      It's typically used in the application's template to define where the component for the current route will be displayed.
 *
 * @property {ActivatedRoute} activatedRoute - Provides information about the currently activated route.
 *                                             It includes details such as the current path, route parameters, and query parameters.
 *
 * @property {RouterLink} link - A utility for creating router links. It is used to generate URLs based on the route configuration.
 *                               This can be particularly useful for creating navigation links in the application's template.
