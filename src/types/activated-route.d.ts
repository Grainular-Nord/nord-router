/**
 * Represents the state of the currently activated route within the NÃ¸rd-Router.
 *
 * @property {string} path - The path of the current route. It's a string that represents the URL path
 *                           that the router is currently navigating. For example, '/home/about'.
 *
 * @property {ReadonlyGrain<string>} current - A readonly reactive data structure (ReadonlyGrain) that holds
 *                                             the current URL as a string. It's a reactive property,
 *                                             meaning it updates automatically as the route changes.
 *                                             This is useful for responding to route changes in a reactive manner.
 *
 * @property {ReadonlyGrain<Params>} params - A readonly reactive data structure (ReadonlyGrain) that contains
 *                                            the route parameters. 'Params' is an object where each key-value pair
 *                                            represents a dynamic segment of the URL (e.g., { userId: '123' } for
 *                                            a route like '/users/:userId'). This property is reactive and updates
 *                                            as the route parameters change.
 *
 * @property {ReadonlyGrain<Params>} searchParams - A readonly reactive data structure (ReadonlyGrain) that
 *                                                  contains the search parameters (query string) of the URL.
 *                                                  Similar to 'params', it's an object with key-value pairs
 *                                                  representing the query string parameters (e.g., { q: 'search' }
 *                                                  for a query string like '?q=search'). This property is also reactive,
 *                                                  updating with changes to the query string in the URL.
